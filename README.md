- **LLM Model**: Llama3-8b-8192

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Anaconda or Miniconda (recommended)
- Groq API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vashu2425/AI-Powered-EDA-Feature-Engineering-Assistant.git
cd AI-Powered-EDA-Feature-Engineering-Assistant
```

2. Create and activate a conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n ai_eda_env python=3.10
conda activate ai_eda_env
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### ⚠️ Compatibility Note

This application requires specific versions of NumPy (1.24.3) and pandas (1.5.3) to avoid binary compatibility issues. The requirements.txt file has been updated with these specific versions to ensure a smooth installation experience.

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter the following error:
```
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

Try the following solutions:

1. Make sure you're using the exact versions specified in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install numpy==1.24.3 pandas==1.5.3
```

2. If you're using Streamlit version older than 1.11.0, you might need to update the code to replace `st.experimental_rerun()` with `st.rerun()`.

3. If you're still having issues, try creating a fresh conda environment with Python 3.10:
```bash
conda create -n fresh_ai_eda_env python=3.10
conda activate fresh_ai_eda_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda activate ai_eda_env
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

4. Upload a CSV dataset and start exploring!
